1. Analyze incoming security alerts/logs

From splunk search
-2 failed login attempts
-Malware detected: rootkit
-Malware detected: trojan

2. Identify suspicious activities. 
i. Failed logins :could indicate bruteforce attempts or someone trying to guess passwords.
ii. Rootkit: highly dangerous, attacker may be hiding inside the system.
iii. Trojan: attacker could gain remote control of the host.

3. Categorize & prioritize alerts by severity
4. ⁠
Failed login attempts (Medium) Could be brute-force but only 2 attempts logged

Rootkit detected (High) Rootkits compromise OS-level integrity

Trojan detected (High) Trojans give attackers control over system

4. Draft an Incident Response Report

Incident Response Report – soc_Task2
- Incident Title: Multiple Suspicious Activities Detected (Failed Logins, Rootkit, Trojan)
- Date: 13/08/25

iii. Trojan Detected
- Description: Trojan malware activity confirmeD
- Impact: Trojan may allow remote attacker access and data theft
-Priority: High

Suggested next steps:
i. Immediately isolate affected system(s)
ii.Run antivirus/EDR scans to remove rootkit and trojan
- Reset passwords for accounts with failed login attempts
- Review system/network logs for lateral movement.
- Escalate to Incident Response Team for full containment and eradication.

5. Simulate communication with stakeholders about the incident
